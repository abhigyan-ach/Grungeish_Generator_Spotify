# Grungeish_Generator_Spotify
A playlist generator using audio features on Spotify's API. 
Often times, I have noticed that I like to listen to specific songs ina particular sequence . While there are few obvious similarities, apart from their sound being rather grunge-ish. While I do have a 
preference for Nirvana, and Green Day they don't quite fall into the realm of a single genre. Spotify's radio feature does provide a strategy for doing so but part of it seems to be influenced by songs you have listened to prior as well. The main purpose of a generator was to generate new unseen songs, which resonate the sound of grunge.
